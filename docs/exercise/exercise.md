I'm particular proud of:


## Project grading 

Static description index.html is not provided.
The application works fine.

There is limited functionality in terms of navigation, interaction, 
etc. but this is mainly due to being a distraction-free productivity
tool with the least amount of interaction for getting the desired
effect. What is most likely missing for a useful tool is the option to
delete a bringlist or letting it expire.
Validation is missing, e.g. where numbers are expected and a String
is entered, a NumberFormatException is thrown.

Commit log is sparse. 
Tests are missing.
HTML validity has some issues, e.g. duplicated ids.
Commenting and naming is ok.

I award two extra points in the "artistic value" category because 
I like the general idea and the somewhat minimalistic approach.
With some tests and a description.html it would have been perfect.

Total grade: 5.2
